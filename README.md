# AIUC-1 — AirCanada Hallucination Evals (Starter)

Minimal, runnable sketch that:
- Generates multi‑turn scenarios from a tiny taxonomy
- Exercises a toy support bot (SUT)
- Judges with two independent rules → escalates disagreements to **Needs Human**
- Aggregates and visualizes coverage for a buyer‑facing summary

## Quick start
```bash
cd aiuc_aircanada_eval/src
python generate_scenarios.py
python run.py
python viz.py
```

Outputs:
- `evals/scenarios.jsonl` — generated scenarios
- `evals/results.csv` — per‑scenario results
- `evals/aggregate.json` — summary stats
- `images/coverage_heatmap.png` — quick visual
- Buyer summary draft: `report/README.md`

## Notes
- The SUT is a toy bot that sometimes **misbehaves** to simulate failures.
- Judges are rule‑based here; swap with your preferred LLMs (OpenAI/Anthropic) in `src/judge.py`.
- Extend the taxonomy in `evals/taxonomy.json`. Keep the *incident → harm → tactic → use case* mapping intact.
- Methodology: attacks now include `authority_invocation` and `false_urgency`.
- The pipeline records `hardness` (easy/medium/hard) and exposes tactic & hardness slices in Streamlit.

### Export a buyer-facing summary
```bash
python src/report_gen.py
# -> writes report/README.md (+ assets, + data)

### 8) Residual risk (Low/Medium/High bands)

We roll up results by use case & tactic with Wilson CIs and a conservative risk index:

```bash
python src/run.py           # writes aggregate.json with "risk"
python src/report_gen.py    # report/README.md includes a snapshot
# or
streamlit run streamlit_app.py  # see the "Residual risk" expander
```

Bands are terciles among groups with n ≥ 8.

Index (judgment call, not a probability):

`risk_index = 100 * (0.60·flag_rate + 0.15·judge_disagreement + 0.25·severity_intensity)`

## Why this fits Rune’s guidance

- He said risk **quantification is hard**; avoid over‑claiming.  
  → We use descriptive stats + CIs + tercile bands, not absolute probabilities.

- He suggested a **top/middle/bottom third** judgment call.  
  → That’s exactly how bands are assigned when there’s adequate coverage.

- It draws a straight line from **incidents → severity → residual risk**, outputting something a **CX leader** can absorb quickly in the product/report.

### Quick smoke test

```bash
python src/generate_scenarios.py --mode template --per-cell 2
python src/run.py
python src/viz.py
python src/report_gen.py
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

- Check aggregate.json → has a "risk" key with by_use_case, by_attack, by_use_case_attack.
- In Streamlit, open ⚠️ Residual risk; tables should populate.
- In report/README.md, see Residual risk snapshot.

If anything looks off, paste me your aggregate.json → I’ll pinpoint and fix.
